## Overview

GuitarHeroJS is a work-in-progress web-based rhythm game that aims to recreate the classic Guitar Hero experience in your browser. Using Three.js for 3D graphics, it features a scrolling fretboard, colorful notes, and particle effects.

## Current State

The game is playable but still in early development. You can hit notes and score points, but many features are yet to be implemented.

- [ ] Improve visual effects and overall polish
