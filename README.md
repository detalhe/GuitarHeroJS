## Overview

GuitarHeroJS is a work-in-progress web-based rhythm game that aims to recreate the classic Guitar Hero experience in your browser. Using Three.js for 3D graphics, it features a scrolling fretboard, colorful notes, and particle effects.

- [ ] Create a proper menu and song selection screen
- [ ] Improve visual effects and overall polish
